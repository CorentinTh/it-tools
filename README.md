```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test

### Create a new tool

To create a new tool, there is a script that generate the boilerplate of the new tool, simply run:

```sh
node scripts/create-tool.mjs my-tool-name
```

It will create a directory in `src/tools` with the correct files, and a the import in `src/tools/index.ts`. You will just need to add the inported tool in the proper category and develop the tool.
